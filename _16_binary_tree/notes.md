**Binary Tree**: Binary tree is a fundamental hierarchical data structure in computer science that comprises nodes arranged in a tree-like structure. It consists of nodes, where each node can have at most two children nodes, known as the left child and the right child.

**Nodes**: Each node in a binary tree contains a piece of data, often referred to as the nodeâ€™s value or key. This node also contains references and pointers to its left and right children so that we can traverse from one node to another in a hierarchical order.
